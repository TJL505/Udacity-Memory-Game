# Udacity-Memory-Game

This is a simple matching game that will be playable as soon as the window opens.

Players click on the cards attempting to match the symbol of the first card with the symbol of the second card. If the cards are not a match, one move will be added and both cards will flip over. The player successfully completes the game when all the cards have been matched.
